VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now deprecated) TrueCrypt.
**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** | Open source client-side encryption for cloud files - Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded.
